# Quick Recap for the basic statistic knowledges

## P-Value
The area under the curve indicates the probability that a person will have a height within a range of possible values

To calculate p-values, you add up the percentages of areas under the curve, including left and right

## Linear Regression
Use a linear squares to fit a line to the data. 
1. First, we calculate the least squared errors
2. Then we measure R squares : 
  For example, X is mouse weight Y is Mouse size
  R-square tells us how much of the variation in mouse sizes can be explained by taking mouse weight into account
$
E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$

\frac{var(mean)-var(fit)}{var(mean)}
